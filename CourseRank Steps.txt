CourseRank Steps:

Step 1

- Display the classes offered for that major (Found in the flowchart) in the main page - Complete
- Create a Navbar
- Create a CoursesList.jsx to link with the navbar (This will display a list of all the courses that have been rated thus far).

Step 2
- Create a user login
- Add a comment section
- Add a date the comment and the user rating was done
- Add graduate classes as well in majors
- Search classes by a subject by adding a subjects table in Supabase (such as: Math, Literature, Science)

Step 3
- Add professors so they can be rated individually include the class they teach. 
- Allow students to setup and save their schedule for the following semester
- Display the professors who teach the classes (Once you search the class)
