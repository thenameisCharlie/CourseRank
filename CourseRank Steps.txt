CourseRank Steps:

Step 1
- Display at least 1 undergraduate major (Computer Science)
- Display the classes offered for that major (Found in the flowchart)
- Display the professors who teach the classes (Once you search the class)
- Create a rating system for the classes and average the total of the response. 
- Create a Navbar

Step 2
- Create a user login
- Add a comment section
- Add a date the comment and the user rating was done
- Add graduate classes as well in majors
- Search classes by a subject by adding a subjects table in Supabase (such as: Math, Literature, Science)

Step 3
- Add professors so they can be rated individually inculde the class they teach. 
- Allow students to setup and save their schedule for the following semester

Step 4
- Use AI to generate classes for the students depending the difficulty they want
